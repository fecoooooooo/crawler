Hey <name>,

I wanted to share with you how much I enjoyed the <game> that you developed, which I found on Google Play. I really love the art style used in the game.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ferenc Dajka, and I am from Hungary (and no, I definitely do not agree with our Prime Minister :P, in case you were wondering). I am a programmer myself and am really into game programming. I am currently looking for job opportunities, and I believe that I could be a good fit for developing games like yours. I was wondering if there are any job openings at your company.

Here are some of my qualifications:
- I have game development experience and have previously worked for Kite Games Ltd (https://kite-games.com/), where we developed Sudden Strike 4.
- I have been working as a programmer for 10 years now.
- I have a Master's degree in Computer Science, and my thesis was also related to game development.
- I have some experience in mobile game development and helped in the release of some games in the past.

If you don't have any current job openings, could you possibly recommend any other places where I can find such opportunities?

Best regards,
Ferenc Dajka
